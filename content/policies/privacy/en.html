        the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
        geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us

<h3 class="h2" id="6">How long do we keep your information?</h3>
<p>We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, accounting, or other
    legal requirements).</p>
<p>If we no longer have a legitimate ongoing business reason to process your personal data, we will either delete or
    anonymize it, or if that is not possible (for example, because your data is stored in backup archives), we will
    securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h3 class="h2" id="7">How do we keep your information secure?</h3>
<p>We have implemented reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
    security of all personal data we process. However, despite our precautions and efforts to secure your information,
    no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
    never be able to defeat our security measures or unlawfully collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
    Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, transmission of personal data to and from our services
    is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
<h3 class="h2" id="8">Do we collect information from minors?</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly request data from or market to children under 18 years old. By using the services, you represent

    of the services.</p>
<p>If we learn that personal data from users under 18 years old has been collected, we will deactivate the account and
    take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware that we have collected
    data from children under 18, please contact us at pizza.azzari@gmail.com.</p>
<h3 class="h2" id="9">What are your privacy rights?</h3>

    laws. These may include the right to (i) access and receive a copy of your personal data, (ii) correct or delete
    your data, (iii) restrict the processing of your personal data, (iv) where applicable, data portability, and (v) not
    be subject to automated decision-making. In some cases, you may also have the right to object to the processing of
    your personal data. You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section
    "<a href="/privacy-policy#12">How can you contact us about this notice?</a>".</p>

    communications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the emails we send or by contacting us using the

    service-related messages necessary for managing and using your account, responding to service requests, or other
    non-marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can
    usually change your browser settings to remove or reject cookies if you prefer. Please note that if you choose to
    remove or reject cookies, some features or services of our services may be affected. More information can be found

<h3 class="h2" id="10">Do-Not-Track controls</h3>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to be tracked online. At this time, no uniform
    technological standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. For this reason, we do not
    currently respond to DNT browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate your choice not to be
    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted in the future that we must follow, we will inform you
    about this practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<h3 class="h2" id="11">Do we update this notice?</h3>
<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised"
    date, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this

    information.</p>
